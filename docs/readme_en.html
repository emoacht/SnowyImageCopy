<div id="main">

<p>Snowy is a Windows desktop app to copy images from FlashAir by a wireless connection. You can copy images in bulk or select from thumbnails one by one. Also you can make this app check new images automatically at a regular interval.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 10 or newer</li>
  <li>.NET 6.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Tested on Windows 10 with SD-WB008G, SD-WC016G (W-02), SD-WE016G (W-03) and SD-UWA032G (W-04).</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>No installation is required.</p>
<p>Settings file will be saved in the following folder.<br>
[system drive]\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\SnowyImageCopy\</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Before using this app, a wireless connection to FlashAir must be established. In addition, <u>other network connections (regardless of wireless or wired) must be disabled temporarily</u> because in <u>AP (Access Point) mode</u>, which is default, FlashAir needs to become virtually the sole access point. To use other network connections simultaneously, FlashAir has to be switched to <u>STA (Station) mode</u> or <u>Internet Pass-Thru mode</u>.</li>
  <li>The thumbnail of an image file not copied to PC yet is shown only when the image is in JPEG format.</li>
  <li>A RAW image file can be copied as well. After copied to PC, if its image format is supported by Microsoft Camera Codec Pack, it will be shown in the thumbnail and in current image.</li>
  <li>A color profile of a monitor will be reflected to current image only.</li>
  <li>To check if a file in FlashAir has been already copied to local folder, its file name and size will be compared. If you make changes to an image file in local folder, including simple rotation, its file size can be changed. In such case, the file will no longer be regarded as the same file.</li>
  <li>"Timeout duration" is the waiting time length for each request out of a number of requests sent from this app to FlashAir during check or copy. If timeout occurs frequently, try making it longer.</li>
  <li>When "Customize folder name for each date" is on, the string for date format will be shown in the textbox. You can specify <u>year-month-day (yyyyMMdd)</u>, <u>day-month-year (ddMMyyyy)</u>, <u>month-day-year (MMddyyyy)</u> formats and can insert "-" or "_" between them (e.g. yyyy-MM-dd).</li>
  <li>When "Handle video file" is on, you will be able to handle video files (MP4, MOV, AVI). The thumbnails will be shown after copied to PC.</li>
  <li>If you usually delete files in FlashAir after copied to PC, it is recommended not to use "Move to Recycle Bin if file in FlashAir is deleted" function.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Card</h2>

<h3>FlashAir card (remote)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The information on FlashAir which is connected by a wireless connection will be shown. This includes SSID and current free space.</li>
</ul>

<h3>FlashAir card (local)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The information on FlashAir which is inserted to PC will be shown. In addition, you can change commonly used settings of CONFIG file such as wireless modes.</li>
  <li>To reflect changed settings, you need to reboot FlashAir. Once rebooted, the network security key will be saved in the protected area and the value in CONFIG file will be replaced with symbols and so you will no longer able to see it. If you lose the key, you will need to set again.</li>
  <li><u>Internet pass-thru mode</u> is a function which enables the connection from PC to the Internet via FlashAir by connecting PC to the access point built into FlashAir and simultaneously connecting FlashAir to another access point provided that such another access point is connected to the Internet. Therefore, settings for both access points are required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions available on Microsoft Store version</h2>

<h3>Switch</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can access multiple FlashAir cards simultaneously. The settings for each card can be switched freely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specify file extensions of target file</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can specify the file extensions (e.g. jpg, jpeg) of files to be targetted by this app. When this is on, the file extensions wil be shown in the textbox. You can specifly multiple file extensions delimiting by space, comma (,) or semicolon (;).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Select only Read-only file on check</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Only Read-only files will be automatically selected after checking images in FlashAir.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do not select once copied file on check</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once copied files will not be automatically selected after checking images in FlashAir. When this is on, the maximum number of files to be recorded as copied will be shown in the textbox. You can change this number by clicking the texbox ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.</li>
  <li>This function will not be affected by changing or deleting a file copied to local folder.</li>
</ul>

<a id="delete"></a><h3>Delete file in FlashAir</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This function tries to delete a file in FlashAir after it is copied to PC.</li>
  <li>It is essential to test this function with your camera before actual use. Since this function uses upload.cgi of FlashAir and it may cause inconsistency of data between FlashAir and camera, <span style="color:red">file system of FlashAir and stored files might be destroyed.</span> What will happen depends on each camera model.</li>
  <li>If upload.cgi of FlashAir is disabled, this function will fail. To check or change this setting, insert FlashAir to PC and use Card function. Or open CONFIG file in FlashAir and directly check UPLOAD parameter (1 means enabled).</li>
  <li>In most cases, you need to reboot a camera to make it recognize the deletion by this function.</li>
  <li>A file with Read-only attribute will not be deleted.</li>
  <li>To use this function, turn on "Choose to delete file in FlashAir on copy" button and type "DELETE" (all uppercase) into the text box which appears next to "Delete file in FlashAir on copy". Then this function will be turned on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Command Line</h2>

<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="head">/autocheck</td>
    <td>Start auto check at startup.</td>
